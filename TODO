List of TODO things

Gnome-CD: 
 * Needs ported to other Unix systems.
 	Linux: Done.
	Solaris: Done.
	FreeBSD: Done
 * Need (better) graphics.
 * Needs a CORBA interface so it can be run as a guiless CD player 
   (possibly by the CD player applet)
 * Buttons need to be run off of a MVC type system.
 * Display needs to be made accessible.
 * Should probably be ported to GStreamer at one point

Gst-Mixer:
 * Needs a CORBA interface.
 * Needs accessibility
 * Device selection
 * Volume/PCM fix
 * Switch Help/about in menu. They are opposite of everywhere else
 * Make the help entry actually load the help

GRecord:
 * Fix appicon

CDDBSlave:
 * Network code needs to be generic.
 * Needs to do submissions.
 * Needs to be able to write out changes in CDDBEntrys
 
VU-Meter:
 * Could be ported to GStreamer. There is a demo app in gst-plugins/level/
   which could be used as a backend for the port. Would need that most apps
   include level plugin in their pipelines for it to work

gstreamer-properties:
 * spec it
 * fix it
 * make it run uninstalled

Misc:
 * Documentation.

Multimedia applets need moved in if thats what we're doing to the applets.
A BonoboControl like the Delphi MediaControl thing.
A BonoboControl for setting the volume like in Windows.

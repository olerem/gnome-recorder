	* main.c: Pet Peeve of mine fixed, the meter values now decay
	(quickly) but the meter will eventually read zero when no noise is
	being played. Its a horrid kludge but it does the job.
	

1999-01-17  Carsten Schaar  <nhadcasc@fs-maphy.uni-hannover.de>

	* main.c (save_state): Removed unused code and set the discard
 	command.
	(main): Removed usage of 'gnome_cloned_client'. Make use of
 	'gnome_client_get_flags' instead.

	* main.c: Added a dialog when esd can't be opened.
	  Also various compiliation warnings fixed.

	* main.c: added a -s option to specify the esd server to connect
	to though it looks like the esd stuff ignores this. :(

1998-11-28  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* gtkledbar.h, gtkledbar.c, main.c: update gtkledbar to take an
	additional argument to the _new() function, to specify the
	orientation as horizontal=0, or vertical=1.  update main.c to 
	take a -v command line parameter to specify vertical layout.

	* main.c : session management experiment. It should deal with the
	session manager now and save/restore its stuff...

USING A SET:

'default' links to the current directory of icons.
Change the link to change icon sets, and recompile.

rm default
ln -s <newset> default
cd ..
make clean all

Enjoy!

Run ./makeset. Should be fairly simple to figure out.

Send me any good icon sets you make, and I'll include them in the next
release.

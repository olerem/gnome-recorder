1999-04-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* cddb.c (tcd_writecddb): modified this function so that it outputs
	valid cddb data files.  Basically just changed PLAYLIST= to PLAYORDER=
	and added blank EXTD and EXTTn lines.  I will have to get it so that
	these fields are read in properly, so that gtcd does not wipe this
	data if it exists in the file.

1999-04-17  James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

	* prefs.[ch]: added some code to load and save http specific cddb
	settings

	* linux-cdrom.h: Wasnt that, reverted change

1999-03-15  Mark Crichton <crichton@gimp.org>
	
	* linux-cdrom.h: Fixed the annoying Illegal Request error popping
	up on my machine.  CDROMCLOSETRAY is only for the OPTI series of
	cdroms.  So we now check to see if CONFIG_OPTCD(_MODULE) is defined.
	If it isn't, we undefine CDROMCLOSETRAY.  Works with Linux 2.2 only.

1999-03-10  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* gtcd.c: (main): Set the display area's background color to black,
	which makes assorted redraws nicer.

	(fill_list): Likewise.

	like "This is...long song".

1999-01-28  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* prefs.c: Added only_use_trkind preference for broken cdrom drives,

1998-12-16  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@po.cwru.edu>

	* cddb.c (tcd_call_cddb_slave): Decrement blen on 1st sprintf.
	Change some >= to > to account for trailing 0 added by 1st
	sprintf.  Should probably modify size of buf to allow for disc's
	with 99 tracks!

	when preferences is clicked

1998-09-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* prefs.c (color_set_cb): Use guint not int for args, and 
	do the function differently since get_i8 no longer takes int* args
	and it might leave the last 3/4 of the int empty. This callback 
	function is missing the alpha argument, btw.

1998-09-22  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* callbacks.c: Include <config.h>.

	* prefs.c: Do not define PACKAGE nor VERSION. Include <config.h>.

	* gtcd.c (create_buttons): Remove _() from pixmap name because it
	is now a picture instead of a word.

1998-08-24  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtcd.c: Fastforward/rewind buttons now work as a real CD player would. Click                        
          and release to change track, hold to skip seconds.                                   
	* linux-cdrom.c: Split tcd_gettime() into two parts.

          superfluous gtk_show_widgets. Fixed changer box packing order.

1998-08-04  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtcd.c (status_configure_event): Fixed the leak that was causing
	the X server to grow to an infinite size -- the status_db pixmap
	was being recreated on every configure event but it was never
	being freed.

	* properties.c (create_status_frame): Fixed erroneous printf format.
	(help_cb): Made void, as it had no return type.
	#include <string.h>

	* gcddb.c (do_cddb): Do not pass more than one parameter to tcd_open_cddb_http().
	#include <stdlib.h> and <string.h>
	(do_cddb): Made void, as the function is not supposed to return

	* gtracked.c: #include <string.h>

	* linux-cdrom.c (tcd_readdiskinfo): Return 0 when the disk is not playable.

	* cddb.h: Added prototype for tcd_open_cddb_http().

	* gtcd.c (status_changed): Made void, as the function does not
	return anything.

	* Removed unused variables all over the place to keep gcc happy.

	* gtcd.c: Added prototype for status_changed().

	* properties.h: Added prototype for properties_cb().

	* gtracked.h: Added prototype for edit_window().

	* gtcd.c (make_button_with_pixmap):
	(make_row3): 
	(setup_pixmaps): 
	(status_changed): Fixed memory leaks caused by not freeing the
	string returned by gnome_pixmap_file().

Mon Aug  3 17:17:08 CEST 1998  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>
	* gtracked.c: Fixed silly clist bug. Now the tracks won't be
corrupted.

...more I haven't managed to save

Craig at crn@ozemail.com.au sent me a few excellent patches for some bugs in
gtcd. Robert Atkey also sent a patch. Thanks!

Thanks to Dennis Payne for the RPM packages.

Thanks to Boris Tobotras for the workbone-tcd converter.

A special thanks goes to the people in #c on Efnet, 
especially Kage, megaton, Wem, and Magnwa for testing and
comments, and Zhivago and Xgc for XLib help.

Greets go to everyone in #linuxos, ndb, kiteguy, NumbLock, marduk, 
Khisanth, ]Arc[, veneficus (forgot to mention him!) etc.

Kha0S, forgot to mention you in the last release. Hi :)

Mad greets (don't ask me), to Lukin!

Thanks to Ti Kan and Steve Scherf, for the CDDB database format
that TCD now uses.

Thanks to whoever drew the nifty CD logo. I'd like to publicly thank the
artist here, but I don't know who drew it. :)

Thanks to Charles Sielski for the nice icon sets.

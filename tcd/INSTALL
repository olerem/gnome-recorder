Installation instructions for TCD 2.0:

Short instructions (as root):

	./configure
	make
	make install

Options for configure:

	--enable-cdchanger 	If you have an ATAPI cdrom changer, and a
				2.1.xx kernel, use this.
	--enable-debug		If you'd like to see a lot of ugly debugging
				junk, use this.
	--enable-notooltips	Use this to disable tooltips.


If you'd like to use a custom icon set, cd to icons and:

Remove the default link:

	rm default

Recreate the default link to your preferred icon set:

	ln -s default RedRock

Change RedRock to whichever set you'd like to use.

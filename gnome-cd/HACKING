Hacking notes for gnome-cd

* ChangeLog entries go in this directory until we merge all of them with
  the toplevel one

DEBUGGING gnome-cd
------------------
* to debug gnome-cd, set GNOME_CD_DEBUG env var
* to print warning messages from code, use gcd_warning
* to print debugging messages from code, use gcd_debug (g_print-like)

DEBUGGING CDDB lookups
----------------------
* kill the CDDBSlave2 component
* set CDDB_SLAVE_DEBUG env var
* start up CDDBSlave2 from the command line

* cddb info is cached in $HOME/.cddbslave/ with files with the discid as
  name
* FIXME: maybe make it use $HOME/.cddb as well ?

* first failed lookup will return NULL data, causing a correct window title
  subsequent lookups (for the lifetime of CDDBSlave2) cause it to return
  Unknown
  restarting the CDDBSlave2 component causes it to return NULL again

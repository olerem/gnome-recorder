      any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same 
      title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives

      not have orginal publisher's permission)  is to include version
      number as part of the title, e.g. MY-GNOME-APP V2.0

	  <para>
		The buttons in the main window should resemble those of a stereo
		system. From left to right, they are:

		  <para><guilabel>Previous track</guilabel> - 
		  	Skips to the previous track.</para>

	  <para>

	   The track editor lets you edit the CDDB information, stored locally,
	   describing the current CD. You may edit the artist's name, the album 
	   title of the disc, and the names of the individual tracks. More
	   advanced uses include the ability to attach comments to the CD, or

 <!-- ============= Various Sections ============================= -->

 <!-- Here you should add, if necessary, several more sect1's,
 describing other windows (besides the main one), file formats,
 preferences dialogs,  etc. as appropriate. Try not to make any of
 these sections too long. -->

 <!-- This section should describe known bugs and limitations of
      the program if there are any - please be frank and list all
      problems you know of.

 <sect1 id="bugs">
  <title>Known Bugs and Limitations</title>
  <para>
   Not all correct theorems can be proved. Please note that due to
      Godel's theorem, any automatic theorem prover must have the same
      bug. Thus, this bug can not be fixed.

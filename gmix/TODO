- rewrite docs in SGML
- store window position/size
- add icons for devices
- configurable devicenames
- add support for sun's /dev/audio style devices. It's easy, just has to be
  done. We have some UltraSparcs at the University, and their audio-applets
  SUCK. Maybe if I can get the admins to install GNOME...

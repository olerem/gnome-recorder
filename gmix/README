GMIX 1.5
--------

This is a XMIX replacement that uses GTK+ to create a user-interface. It uses
the /dev/mixer* devices from the Linux sound-driver.

This is my first bigger program for un*x, and all my documentation was
looking into xmix and soundcard.h. Maybe I've not everything correct, but
it's more flexible (better ?) than xmix already:

- It asks the driver about the number of supported devices and their
configuration. The complete dialog is created from this information.

- The names for the controls are taken as #defined by the soundcard.h.

- You can start gmix for every mixer in your system. The driver for my GUS
MAX creates /dev/mixer /dev/mixer1. One of them seems to be the normal mixer,
the other one seems to be the mixer from the extra audio-codec.

Usage:
	gmix [device]

This version suports gnome_get/set_config calls. These are the supported
sections:

[geometry] ; width and height of the gmix window 
height=200 
width=-1

[_device_] ; One of these sections for each device present on your mixer
titel=Wave ; Titel above the sliders. Default name is as #define'd in
           ; soundcard.h
left=25	   ; left / mono value
right=25   ; right value. ignored for mono channels
recsrc=0   ; if available as recording-source: 1 - enabled, 0 - disabled

[setup]
device=/dev/mixer ; your mixer-device

I'll add more keys, when I get time to do a config-dialog. I hate to edit
dotfiles :-).

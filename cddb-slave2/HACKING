Hacking notes for cddb-slave2

* ChangeLog entries go in this directory until we merge all of them with
  the toplevel one

* CDDBSlave2 is the bonobo component that handles cddb-slave-client requests,
  and creates cddb-slave objects which connect to a server and do lookups.
  It lives for as long as a process still has a cddb-slave-client handle.
  cddb-slave-client handles are created with cddb_slave_client_new () and
  removed with g_object_unref ()
  (main.c)

* cddb-slave is the GObject created by the bonobo component that does the
  actual connecting to the CDDB server.
  (cddb-slave.c)

* cddb-slave-client is the library used by applications.
  The cddb-slave-client GObject is created using cddb_slave_client_new ().
  All requests for lookup are invoked through this object, which then
  calls the appropriate CORBA methods on the CDDBSlave2 component.
  For each slave-client that gets created, a slave object gets created in
  the CDDBSlave2 component.

DEBUGGING CDDB lookups
----------------------
* kill the CDDBSlave2 component
* set CDDB_SLAVE_DEBUG env var
* start up CDDBSlave2 from the command line

* cddb info is cached in $HOME/.cddbslave/ with files with the discid as
  name

cddb-slave2-query
-----------------
* a sample command-line application that can perform lookups given the
  cddb query string used in the protocol.

  arg 1 is the cd's discid
  arg 2 is the number of tracks (n)
  arg 3 .. 3 + n - 1 are the track start offsets
  arg 3 + n is the length of the disc in seconds
  
  Examples:


cddb-slave2-query 9b0ab70b 11 150 18628 34394 50839 69678 79616 99248 134880 151507 164754 189715 2745

returns

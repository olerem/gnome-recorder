Hacking notes for cddb-slave2

* ChangeLog entries go in this directory until we merge all of them with
  the toplevel one

* CDDBSlave2 is the bonobo component that handles cddb-slave-client requests,
  and creates cddb-slave objects which connect to a server and do lookups.
  It lives for as long as a process still has a cddb-slave-client handle.
  cddb-slave-client handles are created with cddb_slave_client_new () and
  removed with g_object_unref ()
  (main.c)

* cddb-slave is the GObject created by the bonobo component that does the
  actual connecting to the CDDB server.
  (cddb-slave.c)

* cddb-slave-client is the library used by applications.
  The cddb-slave-client GObject is created using cddb_slave_client_new ().
  All requests for lookup are invoked through this object, which then
  calls the appropriate CORBA methods on the CDDBSlave2 component.
  For each slave-client that gets created, a slave object gets created in
  the CDDBSlave2 component.

DEBUGGING CDDB lookups
----------------------
* kill the CDDBSlave2 component
* set CDDB_SLAVE_DEBUG env var
* start up CDDBSlave2 from the command line

* cddb info is cached in $HOME/.cddbslave/ with files with the discid as
  name

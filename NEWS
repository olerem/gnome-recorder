1.0.2:

TCD/Cddbslave:
	Now includes a --device option to specify CDROM device file.

	Lots of CDDB fixes and updates from James Henstridge, including
	extended data support and submit capability.

	Changed default CDDB server to freedb.freedb.org, since Escient are
	being dorks about their server. If you find you have a disc which is
	cataloged on cddb.cddb.com, please submit it to freedb.freedb.org.

Gmix:
	Record selection now works.

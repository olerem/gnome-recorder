These are the GNOME media tools for GNOME 2.23 (and beyond):

gst-mixer/              - GNOME GStreamer-based audio mixer.
grecord/                - GNOME Sound Recorder.
gstreamer-properties/   - GStreamer Properties Capplet.
profiles/               - Audio Profile library.

The latest roadmap is published on
http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/GnomeMedia.


Those projects are disabled by default, starting from GNOME 2.23:

gnome-cd/               - GNOME CD player, with CDDB support.
cddb-slave2/            - Helper daemon for gnome-cd's CDDB support.
vu-meter/               - ESD volume level meter. (esd should die, use
                          pavumeter)


Diffs should be done with -U2 option.
The style of code should be the same as the rest of the code in the program:
IE for gnome-cd or CDDBSlave tab setting of 8, braces at the end of lines. etc.

Please pass non-translation patches through bugzilla.

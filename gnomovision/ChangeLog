	* preferences.c: Remove #include <stdinc.h>

	* Makefile.am (LINK_FLAGS): Remove the "about" target.

	* tvset.c (process_help): Comment out make_about_box() since it's
	not anywhere to be found...
	(tv_menu_bar): Comment out signal_connect to "preferences_page"
	since it's not anywhere to be found.
	(tbar): Comment out "Select a channel" since this is no where to
	be found.

	* Makefile.am (LINK_FLAGS): Added -lXxf86dga instead of just
	xf86dga.
	(tvset_LDADD): Added LINK_FLAGS to the tvset target.

	* tv-videodev.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>

	* tv-videodev.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>

	* gnomovision.h: Added placeholder file.

	* tvset.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>...that's not that
 	standard. :)

	* Makefile.am (tvset_SOURCES): Changed "tv-set.c" to "tvset.c"
 	since that appears to be the wrong name of the file.
	(INCLUDES): Added $(GNOME_INCLUDEDIR) so that the proper include
 	dirs get picked up.

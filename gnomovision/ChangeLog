	* tv-videodev.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>

	* gnomovision.h: Added placeholder file.

	* tvset.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>...that's not that
 	standard. :)

	* Makefile.am (tvset_SOURCES): Changed "tv-set.c" to "tvset.c"
 	since that appears to be the wrong name of the file.
	(INCLUDES): Added $(GNOME_INCLUDEDIR) so that the proper include
 	dirs get picked up.

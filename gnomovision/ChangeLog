	* gtv.c: OK.  SOMEONE HELP ME HERE!
	gnome_rootwin used to be used, but now it's gone.
	I am now forced to use a gdk_window_filter function.
	BUT, I dont have gdk events, but X events. :(

	Is there a way around decoding the events...

	* gtv.h: Redid some funcs to represent removal of
	gnome_rootwin

	* gtv.c: changed gdk_visual_get_best_depth for
	gdk_visual_get_system()->depth.  Seems saner?

	* xwindows.c: got bored...replaced some X calls with GDK
	calls.  Wheeeee!

	* tgtv.c: ifdef'ed out the dnd code.  I need to revamp
	DND for the latest gtk-dnd stuff

	* gtv.c: fixed some v4l errors with the ioclts, but it 
	still starts capturing befire the device is fully
	set up.  Also, signals for moving the widget aren't getting
	through, leaving an unsightly mess.

	* xwindows.c: added better check for 32 bit X displays.
	
	* tvset.c: Nuked old argp code

	* gtktv.c: Messed around with some stuff...CVS picked it
	up anyway (no changes)

	* Makefile.am: tgtv not compiled (for now...plan on merging
	tvset and tgtv)

	* gnomovision.desktop: Added Portuguese translation.

	* tvset.c (tv_menu_bar): Re-add the preferences signal_connect.

	* Makefile.am (tvset_SOURCES): Re-add the preferences file to the
	Makefile since all the pieces are there now.

1998-04-11  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* preferences.c: Remove #include <stdinc.h>

	* Makefile.am (LINK_FLAGS): Remove the "about" target.

	* tvset.c (process_help): Comment out make_about_box() since it's
	not anywhere to be found...
	(tv_menu_bar): Comment out signal_connect to "preferences_page"
	since it's not anywhere to be found.
	(tbar): Comment out "Select a channel" since this is no where to
	be found.

	* Makefile.am (LINK_FLAGS): Added -lXxf86dga instead of just
	xf86dga.
	(tvset_LDADD): Added LINK_FLAGS to the tvset target.

	* tv-videodev.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>

	* tvset.c: Removed min() and max() macros since they are in
	gnomovision.h now.

	* xwindows.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>

	* gnomovision.h: Added min() and max() macros.

1998-03-29  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* tv-videodev.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>

	* gnomovision.h: Added placeholder file.

	* tvset.c: Removed #include <stdinc.h>...that's not that
 	standard. :)

	* Makefile.am (tvset_SOURCES): Changed "tv-set.c" to "tvset.c"
 	since that appears to be the wrong name of the file.
	(INCLUDES): Added $(GNOME_INCLUDEDIR) so that the proper include
 	dirs get picked up.

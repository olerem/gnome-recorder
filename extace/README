Extace Waveform Viewer
----------------------

   This is the extace waveform viewer. It plugs itself in as a EsounD
   monitor and samples and displays the output from the EsounD daemon.

   You will need EsounD and the GNU scientific library (gsl) to build
   and run extace. 

   The EsounD daemon 'esd' will need to be running as well (you have to
   start it manually at the moment, this will change soon).

   Currently there are no options or command line parameters.

   The sine.c is an example program to test extace with, just run

	./sine | esdcat

   Enjoy!
